# Voting Machine Project 🗳️  

This repository contains a **Voting Machine** project implemented in **C**, showcasing two different approaches to conducting an electronic voting system. It also includes a project report detailing the implementation.  

## 📌 Features  
- Two different approaches to a voting system  
- Secure voting mechanism  
- Vote counting and result display  
- Detection of invalid votes  

## 🛠 Approaches Used  
1️⃣ **Basic Approach**  
   - Uses a simple structure with `if-else` conditions to count votes  
   - Allows users to cast votes and view results  
   - Handles invalid votes  

2️⃣ **Modular Approach (Functions & Macros)**  
   - Uses functions for better code organization  
   - Defines candidates using macros  
   - Includes a feature to display the **leading candidate**  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maruf346/voting-machine.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Compile and run the C program:  
   ```bash
   gcc voting_machine.c -o voting_machine
   ./voting_machine
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to cast votes and view results.  

## 📜 Requirements  
- GCC Compiler (or any C compiler)  
- Basic knowledge of C programming  

## 📄 Project Report  
The repository also contains a **project report** explaining the implementation, features, and improvements.
